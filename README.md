# hello-world
Just a repo space for me to Git my feet wet

Greetings all!
I'm a tech writer with over 10 years of experience in the development (creation, editing, formatting, proofreading, etc.) of technical documentation for various aspects of IT including software development, engineering, network and information security, and technical support. I've created, edited and managed a wide variety of content such as user manuals, self-help guides, knowledge base articles, technical proposal content, HTML script edits, among other documentation in support of multiple IT projects and departments.  I have always been attracted to learning how things work and discovered that I have a passion and knack for sharing that knowledge in a manner that anyone can grasp, no matter their skill level.
